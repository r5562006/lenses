# Decision Tree Project

This project uses a decision tree algorithm to classify data based on features such as age, prescription, astigmatism, and tear production rate. The script includes functions for encoding categorical data, training the decision tree, and visualizing the decision tree.

## Project Structure

- `lenses.py`: The main script containing the decision tree algorithm and data processing.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision_tree_project.git
    cd decision_tree_project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the `lenses.py` script to create and visualize the decision tree:
```sh
python lenses.py
